# Envelopment

Envelopment is a package that is made to wrap several packages that are quite useful for application development. We can simplify it as curator, wrapper, blueprint, sdk, and more. Why was this created? it's simple, I'm tired of the initial setup when every time I create a service/feature/app. This is very tiring, especially when I'm initializing a project with a microservice architecture.

## Documentation

Please be patient, we'll work on it asap :)
